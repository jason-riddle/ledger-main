; ============================================================
; 206 Hoover Ave - Sheer Value PM owner statement import
; Statement period: 2025-02-01 .. 2025-08-31
;
; Option 1 (you chose): CASH INCOME CORRECT BY DATE
; - We keep a "shadow" Accounts Receivable so you can see what's still owed.
; - When a payment is applied to A/R (oldest-first), we ALSO reclass the same amount
;   from Accrued-Not-Received into regular income on that same payment date.
;
; Key rule:
; - Oldest-first: tenant payments reduce the oldest A/R balances first.
;
; Source mapping:
; - "Detail transactions" Additions to cash (tenant receipts + reversals)
; - "Detail transactions" Subtractions from cash (mgmt fees, owner draws, repairs)
; - Summary for beginning/ending PM-held cash balance
;
; Formatting preference:
; - Negative amounts listed first, then positive amounts.
